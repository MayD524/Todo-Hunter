# Todo-Hunter
A simple tool that looks for all of your TODO comments and ranks them base off the # of O's in the string :>

To build run the ./build.sh script in the src folder

Comment out the windows stuff if you are not building this for windows. If you are building it for windows
then comment out the linux things unless you are cross compiling :) 

I hope you enjoy this little project - May :>
